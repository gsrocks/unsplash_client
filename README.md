# Unsplash Client App
App alows to:
- view Unsplash images feed
- search for specific image
- refresh feed using pull-to-refresh
- tap on an image and go to a detailed screen
- zoom image
- pull down to close image

App is built using _flutter_bloc_, but I'm ready to get into _rebloc_ and other state management approaches.
